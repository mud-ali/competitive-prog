# Competitive Programming Practice

This repo contains my solutions to various competitive programming problems. Solutions are very likely suboptimal, as long as they pass the test cases.

Most problems here are from [Usaco Guide](https://usaco.guide/). Each folder contains one problem. [init.bat](init.bat) is the batch script I use to create each new problem folder. [passed.md](passed.md) contains the list of problems I have solved.
